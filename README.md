# **Beer Ratings Prediction**

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the overall rating of beer using various features, including review text, beer attributes, and user information. The solution focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and robust model evaluation.

## **Problem Statement**
The objective is to predict the **"review/overall"** rating of a beer, which ranges from 1.0 to 5.0, using a dataset that contains information about beers, users, and review details. The problem is formulated as a **regression task**.

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains the following key columns:
- **Beer Attributes**:
  - `beer/ABV`: Alcohol by volume.
  - `beer/style`: Style of the beer.
  - `beer/name`: Name of the beer.
- **Review Details**:
  - `review/appearance`, `review/aroma`, `review/palate`, `review/taste`: Sub-ratings of the beer's characteristics.
  - `review/overall`: The overall rating (target variable).
  - `review/text`: Textual review of the beer.
  - `review/timeUnix`: Timestamp of the review submission.
- **User Information**:
  - `user/gender`: Gender of the user.
  - `user/profileName`: Profile name of the reviewer.

---

## **Solution Overview**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values in `review/text` and `user/gender`.
   - Dropped irrelevant columns with excessive missing values.
   - Extracted time-based features (e.g., month, day) from `review/timeUnix`.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Text-based features: Review length, word count, and TF-IDF vectorization of `review/text`.
   - Statistical features: Mean, standard deviation, max, and min of sub-ratings.
   - Encoded categorical variables (`beer/style`, `user/gender`).

3. **Modeling**:
   - Implemented two machine learning models:
     - **Random Forest Regressor**
     - **XGBoost Regressor**
   - Used hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`.

4. **Validation Metrics**:
   - **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
   - **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
   - **R²** (Coefficient of Determination)

5. **Visualization**:
   - Correlation heatmap for numerical features.
   - Distribution of target variable and feature importance plots.
   - Comparison of model performance metrics.

## **Results**
The two models achieved the following performance metrics:

| Model             | MAE   | RMSE  | R²    |
|--------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Random Forest      | 0.314 | 0.416 | 0.648 |
| XGBoost            | 0.312 | 0.411 | 0.657 |
